# Intensity-Based 2D–3D Registration using DRR Simulation 
## Overview

This project focuses on generating digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) from CT data using cone-beam projection geometry and evaluating image similarity using intensity-based metrics. The framework explores core components required for 2D–3D image registration workflows, including projection modelling and Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) similarity evaluation.



## Key Features

- DRR generation from CT DICOM datasets
- Cone-beam projection geometry setup
- Intensity-based image comparison using NCC
- Framework for future 2D–3D registration development


## Tools & Technologies

- Python
- ASTRA Toolbox
- DICOM processing
- Numerical optimisation concepts



## Pipeline Overview

1. **CT Data Preparation**
   - Load and preprocess CT DICOM volumes.

2. **Projection Geometry Definition**
   - Configure cone-beam projection parameters.

3. **DRR Generation**
   - Simulate X-ray projections from CT volume.

4. **Similarity Evaluation**
   - Compute Normalized Cross-Correlation (NCC) between generated DRR and reference image.



## Results
